I presented some preliminary results from our bioturbator-microbe association project in the first [Ecology in R](ecologyinr.com/) virtual conference. You can download the slides in the button above.

This was a very interesting experience, where the focus was on showing our workflows, the typical packages we used, the limitations and advantages of using R for our projects.
