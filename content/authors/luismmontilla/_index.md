I’m a marine ecologist pursuing my Ph.D. at Stazione Zoologica Anton Dohrn as part of the Marine Symbiomes Research Group. I’m currently studying the role of invertebrate-bacterial associations in nitrogen cycling associated with seagrass ecosystems.

Here you will find my links to my publications, academic social networks, side projects, and occasional blog posts. Feel free to contact me in case of any inquiry!
